    "The main motivation:\n",
    "- Sharable models: Packing model parts, metrics, loss-functions and visualizations into a single recipe, makes the model more sharable to\n",
    "  other projects and supports sharing models for different use cases such as: Only inference, inference+visualizations and \n",
    "  training+metrics+losses.\n",
    "- Shareable Parts: The brick collection encourage users to decouples parts and making also each part more sharable. \n",
    "- Multiple tasks: Makes it easier to add and remove tasks. Each task can be expressed by model parts in a dictionary, \n",
    "  we can easily add/remove them to a brick collection. \n",
    "- By packing model modules, metrics, loss-functions and visualization into a single brick collection, we can more easily \n",
    "  inject it into your custom trainer and evaluation without doing per task/model modifications. \n",
    "- Your model is **not** required to only return logits. Some training frameworks expect you to only return logits - values that go into \n",
    "  your loss function. Then at inference/test/evaluation you need to do post processing or pass additional outputs to \n",
    "  calculate metrics, do visualizations and make prediction human interpretable. It encourage unclear control flow (if/else statements) \n",
    "  in the model that depends on model stage. \n",
    "- Using input and output names makes it easier to describe how parts are connected. Internally data is passed between bricks in a \n",
    "  dictionary of any type - making in flexible. But for each module, you can specific and add and check type hints for input and output \n",
    "  data to both improve readability and make it more production ready. \n",
    "- When I started making a framework suited for multiple tasks, I would passed dictionaries around to all modules and pull out tensors by\n",
    "  name in each module. Book keeping names and updating names was messy. \n",
    "  I also started using the typical backbone(encoder) / head(decoder) separation... But some heads may share a common neck. \n",
    "  The decoder might also take different inputs and\n",
    "  split into different representation and merge again... Also to avoid code duplication, I ended up during \n",
    "  multiple layers of inheritance for the decoder, making reuse bad and generally everything became too complicated and a new task would \n",
    "  require me to refactor the whole concept. Yes, it was probably not a super great attempt either, but it made me realize it should be \n",
    "  easier to make a new task and it should be easier to reuse parts. \n"
